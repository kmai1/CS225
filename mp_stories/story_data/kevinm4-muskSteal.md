Musk shows off his layup package and finishes with a jelly.

# kevinm4-normalLay
Musk already has shown off so much, afraid he'll make his teammates look bad if he does a crazy layup, he goes for a simple lay.

# kevinm4-crazyDunk
Musk is already going crazy. Forget the lay. He keeps showing off by doing a 360, inbetween the legs, double windmill dunk.
