The Ball Brothers take stage. All of the sudden everyone is wearing Big Baller Brand. "TRIPLE B's BABY". The game resumes and Lincoln passes to LaMelo. LaMelo fakes and drives and kicks it back out to Lonzo. Lonzo shoots and misses due to his horrible form. But fear not! While everyone else was playing the game, the sneaky LiAngelo was busy messing with the scoreboard and now the score is 100 - 0. 0.9 seconds remains. LiAngelo has won the game for the Claypots.
